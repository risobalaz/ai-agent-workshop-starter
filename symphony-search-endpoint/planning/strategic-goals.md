# Strategic Goals for Search Endpoint Project

## Goal-001: Design and implement the search endpoint controller
- **Description:** Create the REST controller for handling GET /search requests, parsing the 'q' query parameter.
- **Success Criteria:** Endpoint responds correctly to valid and invalid requests, as per project-specification.md objectives.
- **Dependencies:** Spring Boot framework, existing backend setup.
- **Critical NFR Alignment:** Supports performance and scalability requirements by ensuring the endpoint is modular.

## Goal-002: Implement input validation and business logic
- **Description:** Develop the service layer to validate the input, sanitize it, and prepare the response.
- **Success Criteria:** Input validation handles missing, empty, or invalid 'q' parameters, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.
- **Dependencies:** Goal-001, Spring Validation library.
- **Critical NFR Alignment:** Addresses security requirements by implementing input sanitization.

## Goal-003: Ensure security and sanitization
- **Description:** Implement measures to prevent injection attacks and handle security aspects of the endpoint.
- **Success Criteria:** All user inputs are sanitized, and security vulnerabilities are mitigated.
- **Dependencies:** Goal-002.
- **Critical NFR Alignment:** Directly meets security requirements by validating and sanitizing inputs.

## Goal-004: Optimize for performance and scalability
- **Description:** Ensure the endpoint responds within 100ms and is designed for future scalability.
- **Success Criteria:** Response time < 100ms for typical queries, endpoint designed with modularity in mind.
- **Dependencies:** Goal-002.
- **Critical NFR Alignment:** Supports performance and scalability requirements through efficient design.

## Goal-005: Integrate and test with existing application
- **Description:** Integrate the endpoint into the main application and perform comprehensive testing.
- **Success Criteria:** Endpoint integrates seamlessly, automated tests pass, and existing functionality is not disrupted.
- **Dependencies:** Goal-004, existing backend codebase.
- **Critical NFR Alignment:** Ensures usability and scalability by verifying integration and performance in a real-world context.
