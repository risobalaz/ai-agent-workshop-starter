# Project Specification: Search Endpoint

## Executive Summary
This project aims to add a search endpoint to the existing backend application, enabling clients to query and receive the same query parameter in the response. The endpoint will be simple and focused on basic search functionality, ensuring input validation and handling of edge cases.

## Objectives
- Implement a RESTful GET endpoint at `/search`.
- Accept and validate the `q` query parameter.
- Return the parameter value in the response body for valid inputs.
- Handle edge cases such as empty queries or invalid characters.
- Ensure the endpoint integrates seamlessly with the existing application without disrupting current functionality.

## Functional Requirements
- **Endpoint:** `GET /search`
- **Query Parameters:** 
  - `q` (string): The search query string. Must be provided.
- **Response:** 
  - `200 OK`: `{ "result": "q parameter value" }` if valid.
  - `400 Bad Request`: If the `q` parameter is missing or not a string.
  - `422 Unprocessable Entity`: If the input contains invalid characters (e.g., script tags) to prevent security risks.
- **Input Validation:** 
  - Ensure `q` is present and is a non-empty string.
  - Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks, such as removing or escaping special characters.
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for invalid inputs.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** Validate all user inputs to mitigate risks like XSS or injection attacks. Use Spring's built-in validation mechanisms.
- **Performance:** The endpoint should respond within 100ms for typical queries to ensure a good user experience.
- **Scalability:** Design the endpoint to be modular, allowing future enhancements without major refactoring.
- **Usability:** Follow RESTful conventions and API best practices for clarity and ease of use.

## Architectural Vision
- **System Boundaries:** The search endpoint will be added to the main backend application, leveraging the existing Spring Boot framework. It will operate within the current project structure.
- **Key Components:** 
  - Controller: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
  - Service: Contains the business logic for input validation and result generation.
  - (Optional: Repository or other layers if needed for future integration).
- **Technology Stack:** 
  - Programming Language: Java
  - Framework: Spring Boot
  - Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Validation
- **Integration Points:** 
  - The endpoint will integrate with the existing application. No new external services are required for this initial version, but it should be documented for potential future use.

## Technology Stack (Proposed)
- Java 11
- Spring Boot 2.x (or latest compatible version)
- Spring Web for RESTful services
- Spring Validation for input parameter validation

## Integration Points (High-Level)
- The endpoint will be part of the main backend. If the application uses a build tool like Maven, ensure dependencies are added accordingly.

## Success Criteria
- Endpoint returns the correct value for valid queries within 100ms.
- Input validation correctly handles missing, empty, or invalid `q` parameters, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.
- The endpoint does not break existing functionality or API contracts.
- Automated tests (if implemented) verify all specified behaviors.

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Assumes the backend is a Spring Boot application with Maven or Gradle build system.
- Assumes no existing search functionality to avoid conflicts.
- Development environment includes Java JDK 11 and Maven.
